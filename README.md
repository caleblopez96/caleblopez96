### Hello ðŸ‘‹<br>

Iâ€™m a full-time student at Arizona State University studying full-stack web development, with hands-on experience writing production-level C#, SQL, and JavaScript. I recently completed a software development internship at Cambridge Investment Research, where I built a service that integrated with the FINRA API to automatically update the companies internal database with the latest regulatory information. I worked primarily with C# (.NET) and SQL gaining hands-on experience in backend development, API integration, and database operations.
