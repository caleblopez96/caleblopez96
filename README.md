### Hello ðŸ‘‹<br>

My name is Caleb. I am a full-time student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Graphic Information
Technology with a focus in full-stack web development from Arizona State University. 
I am passionate about solving problems with code, and I thrive on the challenges that web
development offers.<br>

I'm constantly seeking the opportunity to learn and improve my full-stack web development skills. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, frameworks, and languages to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. <br>
