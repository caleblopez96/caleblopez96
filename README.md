### Hi there ðŸ‘‹<br>

Welcome to my Github profile! My name is Caleb and I am a full time student studying Full-Stack Web Development. Currently, I am proficient in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and can create small to medium sized web applications. <br>

I am passionate about logical-problem solving and UI/UX design which made the decesion to pursue full-stack web development easy. I prioritize writing maintainable and scalable code and understand how important attention to detail is for a full-stack web developer. <br>

I'm constantly seeking the opportunity to learn and improve my full-stack web development skills. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, frameworks, and languages to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.
